> I didn't feel up to actually taking notes during the session, as I was pretty tired at the time. Here is what I remember of the important details. If you have more notes to add *please let me know* and I can add them to this.

We started out one again in the strange cave from the [previous session](Session-2-notes). We explored to the left side of the dungeon, to find a room mad entirely of bone.

We move back to the middle room, and Shnarkle attempts to throw some rations at the bone hexagon, while the rest of us are hidden in the passages. However, he accidentally pushed the earth hexagon. There is a green flash and nothing else happens.

We discuss and decide to actually push the bone hexagon, and there is another green flash with no accompanying effects. We then agreed to press the dragon button. After this the wall folds in to become an archway, and we move forward.

Inside is a zombified [dragonborn](NPC's\dragonborn.md). He claims that [Sarkas](NPC's\Sarkas.md) has sent many groups to kill him, and that it is starting to be annoying. We start to get the upper hand, before he makes his escape into one of the pillars
