### Intro and Travel
Muirbrek, Shnarkle, Lileth, and Rar Summerfang introduce themselves. [Sarkas](Sarkas.md) also introduces himself, and offers a reward if we(the party) investigate an incident at Aldritch farm. We ask [Aldritch](Aldritch.md) about it, and he tells us where his farm is and what he believed happened there.
### Investigation
We make our way to the [Aldritch farm](Aldritch-Farm.md), and discover it is strangely untouched. There is a half inch layer of dust, despite [Aldritch](Aldritch.md) supposedly only leaving a couple days before. We find three knolls inside the building, and one comes in from behind us. Defeating them, we discover they hold a map and a strange symbol on their shoulders.
