### Intro and Travel
Murbrek, Shnarkle, Lilith, and Rar Summerfang introduce themselves to each other. [Sarkas](Sarkas.md) also introduces himself, and offers a reward if we(the party) investigate an incident at [Aldritch farm](Aldritch-Farm.md). We ask [Aldritch](Aldritch.md) about it, and he tells us where his farm is and what he believed happened there.
### Investigation
We make our way to the Aldritch farm it is strangely untouched. There is a half inch layer of dust, despite Aldritch supposedly only leaving a couple days before. We find three knolls inside the building, and one comes in from behind us. Defeating them, we discover they hold a map and a strange symbol on their shoulders.

### Travel
We continue our journey following the map we discovered off the Gnolls. We make it about half way, before taking camp. During the night, we are disturbed by a ghost. By the next day, we make our way into the dead forest, and discover a ruined stone village overtaken by decay. 
### The ruined village
In the middle of the [village](Locations\Ruined-village.md) is a ravine, with a tunnel inside. We enter, and find a small intricately decorated. There are 7 hexes on the wall, and a puzzle to identify what to push. In the left side room, there are several more Gnolls, which we overcome.

We continue to explore the cave. There is a room made entirely of bone on the right side. We push a couple of the hexagons in the middle room, and it opens to another room, with a zombified [dragonborn](NPC's\dragonborn.md) inside. It appears that he is the cause of the attack on Aldritch's home, and we try to defeat him. However, he escapes despite our efforts.
