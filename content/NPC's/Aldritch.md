Aldritch is a Simple farmer in [Dragonview](Dragonview.md). Most of his livelihood is his sheep, but he also sold produce. [Aldritch's home/farm](Aldritch-Farm) was attacked by Gnolls, and all his sheep were killed. Because of this he became a drunk, wasting his time away in a bar.

## Attack of Home
At the very beginning of the campaign, Aldritch had awoken to hear baying dogs at his window. However, he didn't own any dogs, so this was very unusual. Upon closer inspection, he discovered these were most certainly not dogs, but something much larger. Succumbing to his fear, Aldritch hid under his bed. Hours later, he emerged to find all of his sheep were eaten.

## Interactions with {party name}
Starting off the campaign, [Sarkas](Sarkas) pointed {party name} to Aldritch, where Aldritch told his story about the attack of his home. We offered to avenge the sheep and to take back Aldritch's farm, and he gave directions to his farm.

Aldritch then passed out from his drunkenness. After this, Shnarkle tries to bribe the bartender into never giving any alcohol to Aldritch. However, there is little Shnarkle can do about their best customer.
