# Interactions with {party name}
Sarkas was the person who originally gathered the {party name}, and sent them on their first quest. He first met them in Dragonview's local tavern, and had wished to remain anonymous. However, Shnarkle eventually managed to get a name out of him. Afterword, he explained how much he loved Dragonwood, and wished to see it safe. He explained the events at [Aldritch's home](Aldritch-Farm), and the party accepted a quest to investigate what happened.
