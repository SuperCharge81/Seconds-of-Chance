title: Welcome to the Seconds of Chance wiki!
---

This is a collection of player notes, theories and ideas (to reduce bloat on the group chat) for the Seconds of Chance game.

Keep in mind that I'm not quite finished, and have plans to add much more!

## Getting Started
Here is a list of important pages, and many more can be found in the Explorer
- [Locations](Lists-of-locations)
- [NPCs](List-of-NPCs)
- [Session Notes](Session-notes-list)

## Contributing

If you have a github account, I can add you as a contributor and you can add pages yourself.  <br>
If you don't, You can either email them to me in plain text, but if your willing to format yourself, that would be very helpful. This wiki uses mostly markdown, which is very easy to learn(takes about 5 min). Get started at [this guide](https://github.com/SuperCharge81/Seconds-of-Chance-wiki/blob/main/Markdown-Basics.md) that I made or for more detailed information you could go [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)(external site).
